# Computational-Physics-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

This is a project for my Computational Physics course at the University of Manchester.

The aim of this project was to simulate the penetration of neutrons through different three slabs of different materials, namely water, lead
and graphite. All three slabs had the same finite thickness of 10 cm. Since neutron scattering or absoprtion in a material is a random process,
this project uses the Monte Carlo method to simulate the activity of neutrons in the three materials.

The transmission, reflection and absorption fractions of neutrons for each slab of material was determined. The largest transmission fraction
was observed for  graphite at 30.74%. So neutrons penetrate through graphite best. Water had the smallest transmission and reflection fractions,
at  0.35% and 19.84%. So water is the least penetrative material for graphite and is also the best material for absorbing neutrons. 

All relevant graphs and results that were produced using the simulation code can be found in the pdf file.
